## My configuration files and automated setup for neovim

### Setup scripts are in ~/.config/scripts/

- If using ubuntu or wsl make sure to run sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade before running scripts
- Put bootstrap.sh and setup.yml in the same directory, make bootstrap.sh executable, then run bootstrap.sh
- LazyVim settings are in ~/.config/nvim
- If using the neovim vscode plugin on Wsl make sure to set the neovim init path to ~/.config/nvim/vscode/init.lua
